    <h2>2. Project Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Join is a student group project created for educational purposes. This privacy policy explains
      how personal data is processed when using the Join web application.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data We Process</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Account and Authentication (Firebase Authentication)</h3>
    <p class="m-bottom16">
      When you register or log in to the application, authentication is handled via Firebase
      Authentication. During this process, the following personal data is processed and stored:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your email address</li>
      <li>A technical user identifier (UID) assigned by Firebase</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is required to create and manage user accounts, to authenticate users, and to
      associate app content (such as tasks or contacts) with a specific user.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 App Data (Firestore Database)</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the application (e.g., creating tasks, contacts, or other entries), the data you
      provide is stored in Google Firebase Firestore. This may include names, email addresses, phone
      numbers, task details, and other content you enter within the app.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Technical Data and Hosting</h3>
    <p>
      This application is hosted on infrastructure provided by
      <span class="highlight">Developer Akademie GmbH</span>. When you access the website, technical
      data may be processed automatically, including IP address, date and time of access, requested
      URL, browser type, and operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data is processed to ensure the secure and reliable operation of the website and is
      typically stored in server log files. We do not evaluate this data for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Purposes and Legal Bases</h2>
    <p class="m-bottom16">We process personal data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide authentication and access control (login/register)</li>
      <li>To store and display application content you create (e.g., tasks, contacts)</li>
      <li>To ensure technical functionality, stability, and security</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Legal bases may include Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract / providing the service)
      and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests in operating and securing the service).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services (Firebase / Google)</h2>
    <p>
      We use Google Firebase (Firebase Authentication and Firestore). Firebase is a service provided
      by Google Ireland Limited (or affiliated entities). Data may be processed on Google servers,
      and depending on configuration and location, data transfers to countries outside the EU/EEA
      may occur.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Cookies, Tracking and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use analytics or tracking tools (such as Google Analytics). The application may use
      technically necessary storage mechanisms (e.g., local storage or session storage) to keep you
      signed in and to provide core functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We store personal data only as long as necessary for providing the application or as required
      for the purposes described above. You may request deletion of your account and associated data
      via the contact details listed above.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Under the GDPR, you have the right to request access, rectification, deletion, restriction of
      processing, data portability, and to object to processing in certain cases. You also have the
      right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
    </p>
